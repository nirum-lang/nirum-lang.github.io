<article><h1>Step-by-step tutorial</h1>
<p>Estimated time to complete this tutorial (reading and exercising): an hour.</p>
<p>FYI there’s the Git repository which contains all example source codes
from this tutorial: <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum-tutorial-examples">https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum-tutorial-examples</a>.</p>
<h2>What Nirum is for</h2>
<p>Today we live in the age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservices</a>.  Traditional function calls
in a single process and a single language have been replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">remote
procedure calls</a> through multiple languages.  It means we cannot call
<code>f(x)</code> anymore but instead need to serialize arguments into JSON,
make an HTTP request, await a response from the server, parse the response,
and validate the result if it is in the allowed range.
Function definitions become even more complicated than function calls –
you need to make a server!  How about unit tests?  Hundreds of test cases
about malformed JSON input data are not uncommon.  Unit tests easily turn
indistinguishable from functional tests.</p>
<p>Nirum is both an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language">IDL</a> which stands for interface description language and
the compiler implementation of the language at a time.  The language
purposes to define signatures of remote procedures and data types used for
parameters and return values.  The point is that it defines only an interface;
an implementation for it is written in a general-purpose language like Python.
The interface code looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">service greet-service (
    text greet (text name)
);
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler takes an interface written in Nirum language and generates
a stub code for the implementation in a general-purpose language.
If the <em>target language</em> is Python it looks like the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class GreetService:
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, it could be Java:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public interface GreetService {
    @Nonnull
    public String greet(@Nonnull String name);
}
</code></pre>
<p>All that remain are to fill the body of <code>greet()</code> with actual
implementation and to call the function.  Let us imagine that
an implementation is like the following Java code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class GreetServiceImpl implements GreetService {
    @Nonnull
    public String greet(@Nonnull String name) {
        // Don't have to check (name == null) here.
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>How is it like to call from a client code?  Let’s try with a Python
interactive shell (run <code>python</code> command without any arguments):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> c = GreetService_Client(...)
>>> c.greet("world")
'Hello, world!'
</code></pre>
<p>That’s all!  All other things like making an HTTP request, serialization,
receiving a request, deserialization, data validation, and making errors
don’t have to be written by you but are generated by the compiler.
Note that the <code>name</code> argument in the above implementation code does not
check if it is <code>null</code>.  Since the parameter type is not defined as
an optional type (i.e., <code>text name</code> instead of <code>text? name</code>), it is
guaranteed not <code>null</code>.  Argument values are validated first.</p>
<p>To sum up, Nirum helps microservices architecture to be easily achieved
and robust for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It hides implementation details of transportation and data coding.
Not only it reduces the amount of the code you need to write,
it does more like better error handling than average microservices.
The points you need to cover with unit tests are also reduced to
a large extent.</p></li>
<li><p>It makes much simpler assumptions about arguments and return values.
The code you write doesn’t need to check if any required field is present
or it’s a proper <a href="https://xkcd.com/1179/">ISO 8601</a> timestamp string, but is enough by only
defining a record type or typing a parameter as a <code>datetime</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">Mock objects</a> become unnecessary by decoupling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(object-oriented_programming)">interfaces</a> from
implementations, and it means writing unit tests become much easier
and enjoyable, and you can focus to the pure logic, so that you become
to write concrete examples and enumerate much more corner cases of
the logic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this article illustrates how you can utilize Nirum for
your microservices through the steps by examples.</p>
<h2>Installing compiler</h2>
<p>The Nirum compiler works on the most major platforms like Linux, macOS, and
Windows.  The <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/releases">official releases page</a> provides the prebuilt executable
binaries for these three platforms.  Note that there is no stable version
(i.e., v1.0.0 or higher) as of May 2018.</p>
<p>This tutorial assumes that you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>downloaded the right binary for your system,</li>
<li>named it <code>nirum</code>,</li>
<li>given it appropriate permissions (e.g., <code>+x</code>), and</li>
<li>placed it in one of your <code>PATH</code> directories</li>
</ul>
<p>so that <code>nirum</code> in the command-line invokes the compiler (<code>$</code> indicates
a command-line prompt and it’s consistent within this tutorial):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nirum -v
0.5.0
</code></pre>
<h2>Service interface</h2>
<p>In order to show the elementary features of Nirum, this section supposes
a simple artificial example: a counter.  It has a state of a natural number,
and the state starts with zero.  Client code can increment the state by 1
and get the current state (after incremented) at a time.  Long story short,
it’s merely like a microservice version of <code>++state</code>.</p>
<p>How does the interface of the counter service look like?</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">service counter (
    bigint increment ()
);
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>service</code> keyword in the above code is for a service definition, and
<code>counter</code> which follows is the name of the service.  It has one method named
<code>increment</code> which takes no arguments and returns an arbitrary precision
integer (that’s what <code>bigint</code> means).  If it had any parameters it would be
between the parentheses, but it’s empty in the above method.</p>
<p>There are other built-in number types as well: two signed integer types
(<code>int32</code>, <code>int64</code>), two signed floating-point number types (<code>float32</code>,
<code>float64</code>), and an arbitrary real number type (<code>decimal</code>).</p>
<p>In Python, all built-in integer types correspond to <code>int</code> and floating-point
numbers correspond to <code>float</code>.  The <code>decimal</code> is mapped to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal"><code>decimal.Decimal</code></a>.</p>
<p>Save this as a file named <em>counter.nrm</em>.  Nirum source files end with
the suffix <em>.nrm</em>.  To make the compiler compile an interface to
a target language, a source tree need to be a <a href="./package.html">Nirum package</a>.
A minimal example of Nirum package look like the below directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>/
<ul>
<li>package.toml</li>
<li>counter.nrm</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Every Nirum package has its own <em>package.toml</em> manifest.  As the suffix
implies, it is written in <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">version = "1.0.0"
description = "A useless counter service"
</code></pre>
<p>Wait, have we decided what language we target to?  In this tutorial,
we choose Python as a target language, because it’s the most mature
target language of the Nirum compiler at this moment.</p>
<p>In order to add a target language, we need a corresponding <code>targets.LANGUAGE</code>
section as well.  In case of Python, it’s <a href="./target/python.html"><code>targets.python</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">version = "1.0.0"
description = "A useless counter service"

[targets.python]
name = "counter-schema"
</code></pre>
<p>What does <code>targets.python.name</code> field mean?  Not only the compiler builds
a single Python source file, but it generates a Python package which
consists of Python source files that define interfaces and <em>setup.py</em> file.
So a Python package can be installed (and should be done) with <a href="http://pip-installer.org/"><code>pip</code></a>
and also can be submitted to PyPI (whichever it’s official or private).
If we configure <code>name = &quot;counter-schema&quot;</code> the <code>name</code> field of <em>setup.py</em>
file is set to <code>'counter-schema'</code> so that you can uninstall it by
<code>pip uninstall counter-schema</code> command after you’ve installed it.
The <code>name</code> also can be appeared in the URL of the package on PyPI
(e.g., <code>https://pypi.python.org/pypi/counter-schema</code>) if it’s submitted.</p>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>Now we have the most minimal Nirum package that can be compiled.
Let’s compile it to a corresponding Python package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nirum --target=python --output-dir=out/ .
</code></pre>
<p>The above command can be broken down into two options and an argument:</p>
<p><code>--target=python</code>
:   It configures the language we target to Python and can be shorten as
<code>-t python</code>.</p>
<p><code>--output-dir=out/</code>
:   It configures a path of the directory that the generated Python files
go into.  It is okay even if <em>out/</em> directory does not exist yet.
The compiler makes a directory if necessary.  It can be shorten as
<code>-o out/</code>.</p>
<p><code>.</code>
:   It refers to a directory that contains the Nirum package we are going
to compile.  It must be a directory that contains <em>package.toml</em>
at least; in the above example it means there must be <em>./package.toml</em>
file.  (If it were <code>src/</code> instead of <code>.</code>, there would have to be
<em>src/package.toml</em> file.)</p>
<p>As a result, several files are made in the <em>out/</em> directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>out/
<ul>
<li>MANIFEST.in</li>
<li>setup.py</li>
<li>src/
<ul>
<li>counter/
<ul>
<li>__init__.py</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>src-py2/
<ul>
<li>counter/
<ul>
<li>__init__.py</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Two text files in the top-level are for Python packaging.  Python packaging
tools like <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> recognize them.</p>
<p>The <em>src/</em> directory contains the actual Python source files.
You can observe that <em>counter.nrm</em> file we made corresponds to
<em>counter/__init__.py</em> file.</p>
<p>The <em>src-py2/</em> directory is merely a clone of <em>src/</em> except it’s ported to
Python 2.7[^1] as its name implies.  You don’t have to be aware of
the distinction of two major Python versions; setup.py automatically
switches between them; even if you pack <a href="http://wheel.rtfd.org/">wheel</a> files (i.e., <em>*.whl</em>)
two version-tagged wheels are created (further reading: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425/">PEP 425</a>).</p>
<p>As you can guess, the <em>out/</em> directory itself is a complete Python package
which can be installed using <code>pip</code> installer.</p>
<p>So how was <code>counter.counter</code> service compiled in Python?  Although we can
look at the generated <em>out/src/counter/__init__.py</em> source file,
unfortunately it’s not that human-readable.  Because it’s only for
machines!  Nevertheless, we can remove extrinsic details from it and
reformat the code to scan its gist; it’s like the below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from nirum.service import Service
from nirum.transport import Transport

class Counter(Service):
    def increment(self) -> int:
        raise NotImplementedError('Counter has to implement increment()')

class Counter_Client(Counter):
    """The client object of :class:`Counter`."""

    def __init__(self, transport: Transport) -> None:
        ...

    def increment(self) -> int:
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>To sum up, it defines two classes: <code>Counter</code> and <code>Counter_Client</code>.
We can guess several things from this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The name in lowercase, <code>counter</code>, is translated to a PascalCase name,
<code>Counter</code>.  That’s right; every type name becomes a PascalCase
when it’s translated to a Python class (e.g., <code>foo-bar</code> becomes <code>FooBar</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, the method name in lowercase, <code>increment</code>, is left
as it was: <code>increment</code>.  The truth is that every name other than type name
(i.e., name of method/parameter/field) becomes a snake_case when it’s
translated a Python name (e.g., <code>foo-bar</code> becomes <code>foo_bar</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Since Python doesn’t have any explicit interface type (like Java
<code>interface</code>), the de-facto interface type <code>Counter</code> defines its methods
raising <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#NotImplementedError"><code>NotImplementedError</code></a>.  Indeed it is
the common practice to define an interface in Python community.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned in the above, we can observe that <code>bigint</code> is translated to
<code>int</code> in Python.</p></li>
<li><p>There is also a built-in implementation of <code>Counter</code>, <code>Counter_Client</code>.
We are not sure what it purposes, but it seems like a kind of
a client-side correspondence of <code>Counter</code>.  It will be discussed
later in this tutorial.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the detailed rule of naming in the Nirum language has not been
explained, you may wonder about this.  To be mostly portable and compatible
with many programming languages, it has the very limited naming rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names can consist of Latin alphabets, Arabic digits, hyphens, and
underscores.</li>
<li>Names can start with only Latin alphabets.</li>
<li>Cases are insensitive.  E.g. <code>foo</code>, <code>Foo</code>, and <code>FOO</code> are all equivalent.</li>
<li>Hyphens and underscores are indistinguishable each other.
E.g. <code>foo-bar</code> and <code>foo_bar</code> are the same.</li>
<li>Hyphens and underscores only purpose to divide words; they cannot be
continuous more than once.  E.g., <code>foo-bar</code> is okay, but neither
<code>foo--bar</code> nor <code>foo_-bar</code> is disallowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though you can code a name with <code>foo-bar</code>, <code>Foo-Bar</code>, or <code>FOO_BAR</code>,
the suggested style is <code>foo-bar</code>.</p>
<p>[^1]: Wonder why the compiler does not generate a single Python source tree
that works on both Python 3 and 2.7?  Because the Nirum compiler aggressively
annotates type hints using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">standard <code>typing</code> module</a> to leverage
Nirum IDL’s well-typeness.  As the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/">annotation syntax</a> used by
type hint annotations is introduced since Python 3, we need to port
the result code to Python 2 by removing these type annotations.
Further reading for modern Python type hints: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/">PEP 3107</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/">PEP 483</a>, and
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/">PEP 484</a>.</p>
<h2>Filling interface with implementation</h2>
<p>Before implementing the <code>increment()</code> method, we need to setup a minimal
environment for programming Python.  In this tutorial, we’re going to keep
assuming we use Python 3.4[^2] or higher.  (Recommend Python 3.6 though.)</p>
<p>Also as more source trees are getting involved, this article assumes
you place Nirum package files in the above into <em>~/counter-schema/</em> directory.
So it looks like the following hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li>~/counter-schema/
<ul>
<li>package.toml</li>
<li>counter.nrm</li>
<li>out/
<ul>
<li>MANIFEST.in</li>
<li>setup.py</li>
<li>src/
<ul>
<li>counter/
<ul>
<li>__init__.py</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>src-py2/
<ul>
<li>counter/
<ul>
<li>__init__.py</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to fill the interface we made in the above with an actual
implementation.  In this chapter, we work on <em>~/counter-server/</em>, an other
directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ mkdir ~/counter-server/
$ cd ~/counter-server/
</code></pre>
<p>Although you probably are already aware unless you haven’t used Python before,
mostly every Python project need a corresponding virtual environment, also
known as “venv.”  You can thought it as a project workspace; it consists of
interpreter settings (e.g., Python version to use) and third-party
dependencies.  A new virtual environment can be created using <code>pyvenv</code>
command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pyvenv venv
</code></pre>
<p>As a result it makes a directory named <em>venv</em> (configured through
the argument of <code>pyvenv</code> command):</p>
<ul>
<li>~/counter-server/
<ul>
<li>venv/
<ul>
<li>bin/ <em>(or <em>Scripts/</em> on Windows)</em>
<ul>
<li>activate <em>(or <em>activate.bat</em> on Windows)</em></li>
<li>python <em>(or <em>python.exe</em> on Windows)</em></li>
<li>pip <em>(or <em>pip.exe</em> on Windows)</em></li>
<li><em>(et cetera)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>lib/
<ul>
<li>python3.6/  <em>(depending on your Python version)</em>
<ul>
<li><em>(omitted)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>(et cetera)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>include/
<ul>
<li><em>(omitted)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>pyvenv.cfg</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>While creating a virtual environment has to be executed only once,
you need to <em>activate</em> it everytime you’re starting to work on the project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ . venv/bin/activate
(venv) $
</code></pre>
<p>Notice a <code>(venv)</code> indication in the above prompt.  It shows that you’ve
activated the virtual environment.  A way to activate a virtual environment
may vary on the platform or the shell.  For example, if you’re on Windows
the way to activate it is like the below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">C:\counter-server\> venv\Scripts\activate.bat
</code></pre>
<p>See also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments">creating virtual environments</a> on the official docs
of <code>pyvenv</code> for details.</p>
<p>After activating the environment, <code>pip</code> becomes to install Python packages
in the environment, not the system global.  Let’s install the Python package
we generated in the above[^3]:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pip install --editable ~/counter-schema/out/
</code></pre>
<p>You can utilize the Python interactive shell to check if the package is
installed well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> import counter
>>> counter
<module 'counter' from '~/counter-schema/out/src/counter/__init__.py'>
</code></pre>
<p>Finally it’s ready to implement the method.  The possible smallest working
implementation would be like the below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from counter import Counter

class CounterImpl(Counter):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.state = 0
    def increment(self) -> int:
        self.state += 1
        return self.state
</code></pre>
<p>What a dumb implementation!  It has its own <code>state</code> which counts from 0.
The <code>increment()</code> method just increments the <code>state</code> by 1 and returns
the current <code>state</code>.</p>
<p>Save the below Python code to <em>counter_server.py</em> to try to run.
Now <em>~/counter-server/</em> directory has more files:</p>
<ul>
<li>~/counter-server/
<ul>
<li>venv/
<ul>
<li><em>(omitted)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>counter_server.py</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>[^2]: Because it is the least Python version with built-in both <code>pip</code> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html"><code>pyvenv</code></a>.  If you’re on Debian/Ubuntu you need to install
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/python3-pip"><code>python3-pip</code></a> and <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/python3-venv"><code>python3-venv</code></a> packages
besides <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/python3"><code>python3</code></a> package.</p>
<p>[^3]: Notice <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs"><code>--editable</code></a> (<code>-e</code>) option.  Without this option,
you need to install the package again everytime any files in
<em>~/counter-schema/out/</em> are modified.</p>
<h2>Remote procedure call</h2>
<p>It’s time to run the implementation.  To run it on the server, we need
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/nirum-wsgi/"><em>nirum-wsgi</em> package</a>[^4] (ensure that you’ve activated
the virtual environment):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pip install nirum-wsgi
</code></pre>
<p>This package provides the <code>nirum-server</code> command which runs a server
of a given Nirum service:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nirum-server -d 'counter_server:CounterImpl()'
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:9322/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 123-456-789
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-d</code> option turns on debug mode, which means the server reloads
every time any of related files changes.</p>
<p>The argument of <code>nirum-service</code> command is a small language that consists of
an import path (i.e., Python module path) followed by a colon, and a following
Python expression, evaluated to a Nirum service instance (not a class itself).</p>
<p>Notice the address <code>http://0.0.0.0:9322/</code> (you can change the port using
<code>-p</code>/<code>--port</code> option); the protocol used for communication between a service
server and a service client is HTTP and it’s intended to be also possible
to be used with any HTTP user-agents – it will be more explained in a later.</p>
<p>However, first of all, let’s try a <code>Counter_Client</code> generated by the compiler.
As a server-side needs <code>nirum-wsgi</code> package, a client-side needs <a href="https://pypi.org/project/nirum-http/"><em>nirum-http</em>
package</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ pip install nirum-http
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a demo session:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from counter import Counter_Client
>>> from nirum_http import HttpTransport
>>> transport = HttpTransport('http://0.0.0.0:9322/')
>>> client = Counter_Client(transport)
>>> client.increment()
1
>>> client.increment()
2
>>> client.increment()
3
</code></pre>
<p>One fun fact is that <code>Counter_Client</code> too actually implements <code>Counter</code>
interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from counter import Counter
>>> isinstance(client, Counter)
True
>>> issubclass(Counter_Client, Counter)
True
</code></pre>
<p>Despite you would be realized soon how useful is this interesting
relationship between both types for unit testing, let’s deal with this later.</p>
<p>Anyway, it works nicely, as if it’s called in a single process!
Under the hood, however, there’s a lot going on such as making an HTTP request.
How does it work then?  We can simulate the way <code>Counter_Client</code> and
<code>HttpTransport</code> objects communicate with the server, using <code>curl</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl -iX POST http://0.0.0.0:9322/?method=increment
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: application/json
Content-Length: 1
Vary: Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS

4
</code></pre>
<p>It’s quite dumb and old-fashioned.  Nevertheless, it is so simple
that in any languages we can call this with only writing few code.</p>
<p>Indeed the protocol is simple and adopts widely-used standards like
HTTP and JSON regardless of inefficiency.  One of Nirum’s goals is
to make any language can easily interoperate with other systems that use
Nirum, even if it is not an official target language of Nirum.
Network or runtime efficiency is a non-goal, or not a top priority
at least, of the Nirum protocol.</p>
<p>To work well with many platforms, Nirum provides a way to route
“fancy URL paths” to corresponding service methods; on the surface,
these URLs can look like “HTTP resources” of typical HTTP REST APIs.
This feature is enabled through an <code>@http-resource</code> annotation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">service counter (
    @http-resource(method = "POST", path = "/count/")
    bigint increment ()
);

<p>What do <a href="./annotation.html">annotations</a> do?  They per se have no meaning, but can be
discovered by target backends in compile-time or by runtime libraries
in run-time, and may be processed.  For <code>@http-resource</code> annotations,
<em>nirum-wsgi</em> server scans them and route an HTTP request to a corresponding
method.</p>
<p>Since we have updated <em>~/counter-schema/counter.nrm</em>, it’s necessary to
recompile them (<code>-t</code> is a shorthand of <code>--target</code> and <code>-o</code> is of
<code>--output-dir</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nirum -t python -o ~/counter-schema/out/ ~/counter-schema/
</code></pre>
<p>The above command replaces the existing files in <em>~/counter-schema/out/</em>
directory with Python files generated anew, and it makes <code>nirum-server</code>
command to reload the service.</p>
<p>Now the service has a slightly better URL path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl -iX POST http://0.0.0.0:9322/count/
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: application/json
Content-Length: 1
Vary: Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS

1
</code></pre>
<p>You may think the number <code>1</code> in the response strange.  It’s because
<code>nirum-server</code> command reloads the service.  As the current implementation
of <code>CountImpl</code> does not save the <code>state</code> into a persistent store
(e.g., filesystem, database) but in memory, reloading it makes the <code>state</code>
starts from <code>0</code> again.</p>
<p>We can fix this by making <code>state</code> to be saved in a file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from counter import Counter

class CounterImpl(Counter):
    def __init__(self, state_path: str) -> None:
        self.state_path = state_path
    def increment(self) -> int:
        try:
            with open(self.state_path, 'r+') as f:
                state = int(f.read() or '0')
                state += 1
                f.seek(0)
                f.write(str(state))
        except FileNotFoundError:
            with open(self.state_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write('1')
                state = 1
        return state
</code></pre>
<p>(Although it doesn’t work properly for concurrent calls, please ignore
that now.)</p>
<p>As a result, the <code>nirum-server</code> process will be unexpectedly terminated
with a Python traceback:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"> * Detected change in '~/counter-server/counter_server.py', reloading
 * Restarting with stat
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "~/counter-server/venv/bin/nirum-server", line 11, in <module>
  ...
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'state_path'
</code></pre>
<p>It’s because we add a <code>state_path</code> parameter to the constructor of
<code>CounterImpl</code> class.  A Python expression in the argument of <code>nirum-server</code>
command also need to be changed (notice <code>&quot;/tmp/state&quot;</code> in the argument):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nirum-server -d 'counter_server:CounterImpl("/tmp/state")'
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:9322/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 123-456-789
</code></pre>
<p>We haven’t touched the interface but only the implementation, so the way
to call the service method has not changed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:9322/count/
1
$ curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:9322/count/
2
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can observe the persistent state from <em>/tmp/state</em> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cat /tmp/state
2
</code></pre>
<p>[^4]: If you are familiar with Python and Python web development, you could
guess what <code>nirum-wsgi</code> package does as the name implies.  It’s a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">WSGI</a>
adapter application taking a Nirum service.</p>
<h2>Method parameters</h2>
<p>The previous example was designed to minimize the complexity by intention.
That’s why <code>increment()</code> method has no parameters.</p>
<p>In this chapter, the <code>counter</code> example slighly evolves.  Previously,
<code>increment()</code> method only can increment the state by 1.  How about making
it possible to increment the state by any delta?  If the previous one is
like a microservice version of <code>++state</code> this one is like a microservice
version of <code>state += delta</code>.</p>
<p>How would the interface be changed?</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">service counter (
    @http-resource(method = "POST", path = "/count/{delta}/")
    bigint increment (bigint delta)
);
</code></pre>
<p>Now the <code>increment()</code> method has a parameter named <code>delta</code>.  It’s typed
as <code>bigint</code> which is the same to the return type.</p>
<p>The <code>path</code> option of the <code>@http-resource</code> annotation also changed;
a variable path component <code>{delta}</code> is appended.  It means
a <code>POST /count/123/</code> request corresponds to a <code>increment(123)</code> call.</p>
<p>As the interface changed, we need to recompile it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nirum -t python -o ~/counter-schema/out/ ~/counter-schema/
</code></pre>
<p>The implementation of <code>increment()</code> method also has to be changed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increment(self, delta: int) -> int:
    try:
        with open(self.state_path, 'r') as f:
            state = int(f.read() or '0')
    except FileNotFoundError:
        state = 0
    state += delta
    with open(self.state_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(state))
    return state
</code></pre>
<p>Again, as we touched <em>counter_server.py</em>, the <code>nirum-server</code> also reloads
the service.</p>
<p>Would it work well then?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> from counter import Counter_Client
>>> from nirum_http import HttpTransport
>>> transport = HttpTransport('http://0.0.0.0:9322/')
>>> client = Counter_Client(transport)
>>> client.increment(1)
3
>>> client.increment(123)
126
</code></pre>
<p>That’s what we’ve expected.  How is it like under the hood?</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:9322/count/123/
249
</code></pre>
<p>That also work well.</p>
<h2>Server-side unit tests</h2>
<p>Although unit testing a microservice is less painful than unit testing
a user-facing app, it is much more complicated than unit testing a library.
If microservice and library are somewhat analogous in the respect that both
are a programming interface, why do not write unit tests for a microservice
instead of functional tests?  If unit tests of a traditional library
don’t deal with calling conventions like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/cdecl">cdecl</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/stdcall">stdcall</a>,
why wouldn’t unit tests of a microservice ignore network transportation
like HTTP, data coding, or serialization like JSON?</p>
<p>Because, whereas such low-level details in traditional libraries are hidden
by <em>languages</em>, usually still no language is adopted for microservices to hide
networking or serialization.  Fortunately, we’ve defined the interface for
our microservice in Nirum, an IDL, which hides such low-level details.</p>
<p>The following <em>tests.py</em> source shows how is unit testing a microservice
like where its interface is defined in Nirum:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os
from tempfile import mkstemp
from unittest import TestCase
from counter_server import CounterImpl

class CounterImplTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        fd, self.path = mkstemp()
        os.close(fd)  # only path is necessary
        self.counter = CounterImpl(self.path)
    def tearDown(self):
        os.unlink(self.path)
    def test_initial_state(self):
        self.assertEqual(0, self.counter.increment(delta=0))
    def test_increment(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, self.counter.increment(delta=1))
        self.assertEqual(2, self.counter.increment(delta=1))
    def test_increment_by_5(self):
        self.assertEqual(5, self.counter.increment(delta=5))
        self.assertEqual(10, self.counter.increment(delta=5))
</code></pre>
<p>The above code uses a unit testing framework named <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a>
in the Python standard library, because it is built-in so that we don’t
need to install it and has the most friendly interface which derives
from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit">xUnit</a>.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.setUp"><code>setUp()</code></a> method tries to make a fixture
instance of <code>CounterImpl</code>.  Since the constructor of <code>CounterImpl</code> takes
a file path to store its state, <code>setUp()</code> also creates a temporary file,
and then <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDown"><code>tearDown()</code></a> method removes it
after tests finish.</p>
<p>The rest <code>test_initial_state()</code>, <code>test_increment()</code>, and
<code>test_increment_by_5()</code> methods test if the <code>CounterImpl</code> instance
satisfies behaviors we expect.  It’s quite straightforward and concise;
it doesn’t have to test like what if the <code>increment()</code> method takes
a string instead of an integer or what if the payload under the hood is
a malformed JSON.</p>
<p>The following command runs tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ python -m unittest tests.py
...
