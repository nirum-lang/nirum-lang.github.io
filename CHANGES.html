<article><h1>Nirum changelog</h1>
<h2>Version 0.5.0</h2>
<p>To be released.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>uri</code> type has completly gone; use <code>url</code> instead.
[<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/126">#126</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/281">#281</a> by Jonghun Park]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Docs target</h3>
<ul>
<li>Docs target became to support manual pages besides reference docs extracted
from Nirum source codes.  It scans all CommonMark (i.e., <em>*.md</em>) files and
transforms them to HTML pages.</li>
<li><a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> in docstrings became to support <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-">table syntax extension</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> in docstrings became to have a limited subset of
<a href="https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#spe-attr">special attributes extension</a>.  It’s only allowed to heading elements and
only anchor identifiers are supported (e.g., <code>{#header-id}</code>).</li>
<li><code>style</code>, <code>header</code>, and <code>footer</code> options were added.  These options purpose
to customize the look and feel of the result pages.</li>
<li>Fixed an incorrect processing of <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> thight list items: it had
crashed when a thight list item contains blocks other than paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Et cetera</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dropped 32-bit Windows support.</li>
<li>The official Docker image repository was moved to
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/nirumlang/nirum/">nirumlang/nirum</a>
(from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/spoqa/nirum/">spoqa/nirum</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.4.1</h2>
<p>Released on June 8, 2018.</p>
<h3>Et cetera</h3>
<ul>
<li>The official Docker images became to have netbase pacakage. See the
<a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2372">related issue on Haskell Stack</a> as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.4.0</h2>
<p>Released on May 25, 2018.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Union tags became possible to have <code>default</code> keyword.  It’s useful
for migrating a record type to a union type.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/13">#13</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/227">#227</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Enum members and union tags became disallowed to shadow an other type name
in a module.  It’s because in some target languages we compile both types
and members/tags into objects that share the same namespace.  In Python,
both types and union tags are compiled into classes.</p>
<p>For example, the following definitions had been allowed, but now became
disallowed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">unboxed foo (text);
//      ^~~
enum bar = foo | baz;
//         ^~~
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">record foo (text a);
//     ^~~
union bar = foo (text b) | baz (text c);
//          ^~~
</code></pre>
<p>This rule is applied even between a member/tag and its belonging enum/union
type as well.  The following definitions are disallowed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">enum foo = foo | bar;
     ^~~   ^~~
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">union bar = foo (text a) | bar (text b);
      ^~~                  ^~~
</code></pre>
<p>If you already have used the same name for a type and a tag, you can avoid
breaking backward compatibility of serialization by specifying a different
behind name.  For example, if you’ve had a definition like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">enum foo = foo | bar;
//   ^~~   ^~~
</code></pre>
<p>It can be changed like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">enum foo = foo-renamed/foo | bar;
//         ^~~~~~~~~~~ ^~~
</code></pre>
<p>[<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/254">#254</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/255">#255</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Enum members and union tags became disallowed to shadow other enum members
and union tags even if they belong to an other type.  It’s because in some
target language we compile them into objects that share the same namespace,
regardless of their belonging type.</p>
<p>For example, the following definitions had been allowed, but now became
disallowed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">enum foo = bar | baz;
//         ^~~
enum qux = quux | bar;
//                ^~~
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">union foo = bar (text a) | baz (text b);
//          ^~~
enum qux = quux | bar;
//                ^~~
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">union foo = bar (text a) | baz (text b);
//                         ^~~
union qux = quux (text c) | baz (text d);
//                          ^~~
</code></pre>
<p>If you already have used the same name for members/tags of different
enum/union types, you can avoid breaking backward compatibility of
serialization by specifying a different behind name.
For example, if you’ve had a definition like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">enum foo = bar | baz;
//         ^~~
union qux = bar (text a) | quux (text b);
//          ^~~
</code></pre>
<p>It can be changed like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">enum foo = bar-renamed/bar | baz;
//         ^~~~~~~~~~~ ^~~
union qux = bar (text a) | quux (text b);
</code></pre>
<p>[<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/254">#254</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/255">#255</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a compiler bug that an error message on name duplicates had referred
to a wrong line/column number.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/255">#255</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Added aliased import.  It’s handy to avoid a name shadowing.
[<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/217">#217</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/258">#258</a>]</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">import iso (country as iso-country);
import types (country);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Added support for integer type annotation argument.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/178">#178</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/267">#267</a>]</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">service foo-service (
    @bar(baz=1)
    int32 qux (int32 quux),
);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Deprecated <code>uri</code> and <code>url</code> type is added.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/126">#126</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/277">#277</a> by Jonghun Park]</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Docs target</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A new required configuration <code>targets.docs.title</code> was added.
It’s rendered in generated HTML documents’ <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element.
[<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/253">#253</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Docs now have a sidebar which contains table of contents.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/257">#257</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that a module-level docs hadn’t been rendered.
Now it’s shown in the right below the module name.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/259">#259</a>]</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Python target</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Generated Python packages became to have two <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#entry-points">entry points</a> (a feature
provided by <em>setuptools</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nirum.modules</code>: It maps Nirum modules to Python modules.
Nirum module paths are normalized to avoid underscores and upper letters
and use hyphens and lower letters instead, e.g., <code>foo-bar.baz</code>.
The table works well with <code>renames</code> settings as well.</li>
<li><code>nirum.classes</code>: It maps Nirum types (including services) to Python
classes.  Nirum type names are qualified and their leading module paths
are also normalized (the same rule to <code>nirum.modules</code> applies here).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Generated deserializers became independent from <em>nirum-python</em> runtime
library.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/160">#160</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/272">#272</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Error messages made during deserialization became more standardized.
Every error now consists of two fields: one represents a path to the
value having an error, and other one is a human-readable message.</p>
<p>For example, suppose there’s types like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nirum">record user (dob date);
record user-group ([user] users);
</code></pre>
<p>and the following payload for <code>user-group</code> type is given:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
  {"_type": "user", "dob": "2000-06-30"},
  {"_type": "user", "dob": "2000-13-32"}
]
</code></pre>
<p>An error is reported with a path like <code>[1].dob</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added an optional <code>on_error</code> callback parameter to generated
<code>__nirum_deserialize__()</code> methods.</p>
<p>It has to be a callable which has two parameters (and no return value).
An <code>on_error</code> callback is called every time any validation/parsing error
happens during deserialization, and it can be called multiple times
at a single call of <code>__nirum_deserialize__()</code>.</p>
<p>The callback function’s first parameter takes a string referring
a path to the value having an error (e.g., <code>'.users[0].dob'</code>).
The second parameter takes an error message string (e.g.,
<code>'Expected a string of RFC 3339 date, but the date is invalid.'</code>).</p>
<p>When it’s omitted or <code>None</code>, a <code>ValueError</code> is raised with a multiline
message that consists of all error messages made during deserialization,
as it has been.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that record/union deserializers refuses payloads without
<code>&quot;_type&quot;</code> field.  It is only for humans and can be omitted according to
the <a href="./docs/serialization.html">specification</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>All integral types (<code>int32</code>, <code>int64</code>, and <code>bigint</code>) became represented
as <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/numbers.html#numbers.Integral"><code>numbers.Integral</code></a> instead of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#int"><code>int</code></a>.</p>
<p>There’s no change to Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>uri</code> type became represented as <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#basestring"><code>basestring</code></a>
instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#unicode"><code>unicode</code></a> in Python 2, since URI (unlike IRI)
is limited to a subset of ASCII character set.</p>
<p>There’s no change to Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Generated type constructors became to validate field value’s range or format
besides class checks: range checks for <code>int32</code>/<code>int64</code>, time zone
(<code>tzinfo</code>) awareness check for <code>datetime</code>, and basic format check for
<code>uri</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Generated service methods became to have its own serialization and
deserialization functions.  Each method object now has these attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>__nirum_serialize_arguments__</code> takes the same keywords to the method
parameters and serialize them into a mapping object (which can be
directly translated to a JSON object).  It can raise a <code>TypeError</code> or
<code>ValueError</code> if any invalid values are passed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>__nirum_deserialize_arguments__</code> takes a mapping object returned by
<code>json.load()</code>/<code>json.loads()</code> (and an optional <code>on_error</code> callable)
and deserialize it into a mapping object of pairs from parameter’s
facial name string to its corresponding Python object.</p></li>
<li><p><code>__nirum_argument_serializers__</code> is a mapping object that keys are
a string of method’s parameter facial name and values are its
serializer.</p>
<p>A serializer function takes an argument value and returns
its corresponding value which can be passed to
<code>json.dump()</code>/<code>json.dumps()</code>.  It can raise a <code>TypeError</code> or
<code>ValueError</code> if an argument is invalid.</p></li>
<li><p><code>__nirum_argument_deserializers__</code> is a mapping object that keys are
a string of method’s parameter behind name and values are its
deserializer.</p>
<p>A deserializer function takes an argument value preprocessed by
<code>json.load()</code>/<code>json.loads()</code> with an optional <code>on_error</code> callback,
and returns its corresponding Python object.</p></li>
<li><p><code>__nirum_serialize_result__</code> takes a method’s return value and serialize
it into a corresponding value which can be passed to
<code>json.dump()</code>/<code>json.dumps()</code>.</p>
<p>If the given value does not match to method’s return type it raises
<code>TypeError</code>, or <code>ValueError</code> if the value is invalid.</p>
<p>This attribute is <code>None</code> if the method has no return type.</p></li>
<li><p><code>__nirum_deserialize_result__</code> takes a result value preprocessed by
<code>json.load()</code>/<code>json.loads()</code> with an optional <code>on_error</code> callback,
and deserialize it into its corresponding Python object.</p>
<p>This attribute is <code>None</code> if the method has no return type.</p></li>
<li><p><code>__nirum_serialize_error__</code> takes a method’s error object and serialize
it into a corresponding value which can be passed to
<code>json.dump()</code>/<code>json.dumps()</code>.</p>
<p>If the given error object does not match to method’s return type
it raises <code>TypeError</code>, or <code>ValueError</code> if the error object is invalid.</p>
<p>This attribute is <code>None</code> if the method has no error type.</p></li>
<li><p><code>__nirum_deserialize_error__</code> takes an error value preprocessed by
<code>json.load()</code>/<code>json.loads()</code> with an optional <code>on_error</code> callback,
and deserialize it into its corresponding Python object.</p>
<p>This attribute is <code>None</code> if the method has no error type.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Removed <code>__nirum_get_inner_type__()</code> class methods from generated unboxed
type classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed <code>__nirum_record_behind_name__</code> static fields and
<code>__nirum_field_types__()</code> class methods from generated record type classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed <code>__nirum_tag_names__</code>, <code>__nirum_union_behind_name__</code>, and
<code>__nirum_field_names__</code> static fields from generated union type classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed <code>__nirum_tag_types__</code> static fields from generated union tag
classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed <code>__nirum_schema_version__</code> static field from generated service
classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that generated service methods hadn’t checked its arguments
before its transport sends a payload.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/220">#220</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that field/parameter names that use a module name of the Python
standard library cause runtime <code>TypeError</code>s (due to name shadowing).
Under the hood, all generated <code>import</code>s are now aliased with a name prefixed
an underscore.</p></li>
<li><p>Added Python classifier metadata field.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/100">#100</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/269">#269</a>]</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Et cetera</h3>
<ul>
<li>The officially distributed executable binaries for Linux became
dependent on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">glibc</a> again.</li>
<li>The official Docker images became based on Debian (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/minideb/">minideb</a>) instead of
Alpine Linux.  It’s because Alpine Linux doesn’t provide GHC 8.2 as of
March 2018.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.3.3</h2>
<p>Released on March 15, 2018.</p>
<h3>Et cetera</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a broken build of the official Docker images.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.3.1</h2>
<p>Released on March 1, 2018.</p>
<h3>Python target</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed record/union deserializers to ignore unknown fields in data payload.

</ul>
<h2>Version 0.3.0</h2>
<p>Released on February 18, 2018.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="./docs/package.html">Package</a> is now a new compilation unit of Nirum.
Every Nirum package needs <em>package.toml</em> manifest file.
[<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/83">#83</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/99">#99</a>]</li>
<li>Since a Nirum package can be compiled to more than one target languages,
the <code>nirum</code> command became to have <code>-t</code>/<code>--target</code> required parameter.
[<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/106">#106</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/111">#111</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/114">#114</a>]</li>

<li>Added <code>@error</code> annotation to make a type to subclass an exception base
class (e.g., <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception"><code>Exception</code></a> in Python) when it’s compiled
to OO languages.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/38">#38</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/127">#127</a>]</li>

<li>Fixed a parser bug that a bare identifier (i.e., unquoted identifier) cannot
start with a reserved keyword, e.g., <code>types</code> (<code>type</code> is reserved),
<code>enumeration</code> (<code>enum</code> is reserved).  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/184">#184</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/189">#189</a>]</li>

a trailing comma or newlines.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/202">#202</a>]</li>
<li>Fixed the <code>nirum</code> command bug that it had always terminated with exit code
0 even when it errored.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/issues/97">#97</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/108">#108</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Docs target</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new target, <code>docs</code> is now available.  To generate docs for a Nirum
package, specify <code>--target docs</code> option to the <code>nirum</code> command.

<li>Added new transport layer.  [<a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum/pull/149">#149</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum-python/issues/79">nirum-python #79</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nirum-lang/nirum-python/pull/92">nirum-python #92</a>]
<ul>
<li>Generated constructors of service clients became to take a
<code>nirum.transport.Transport</code> instance.</li>
<li>Followed renamed/moved import paths of the runtime classes
(e.g., <code>nirum.rpc.Service</code> became to <code>nirum.service.Service</code>).</li>
<li>The way to avoid name collision between generated types and runtime
classes is changed.  The runtime library had provided alternative names
like <code>service_type</code> for <code>Service</code> and generated imports had been like
<code>from nirum.rpc import service_type</code>, but it’s now
<code>from nirum.service import Service as service_type</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Record/union tag fields of an optional type can be omitted when
the constructor is called.

<li>Generated tag classes became qualified under its union class
(e.g., <code>Shape.Rectangle</code> instead of <code>Rectangle</code>).
Deprecated the old style and it is going to be obsolete in the near future.
